## Command line for the win

**Background Context**
[CMD CHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/) is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

**Requirements**
Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels. Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format. Additionally, demonstrate the use of the `SFTP` (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.
